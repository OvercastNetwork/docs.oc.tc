                        Notice how we are tightly selecting the map. The checkers represent the chunks loaded. Since we don’t need these, we are just selecting the map. Now that the map is tightly selected, it can be ready to be pruned. To do this, click the
                        %code Chunk Control
                        button on the bottom right.
                        %p
                        %code Note:
                        You must be in "Chunk View" in order for this to work.

                        Now you can prune the map by clicking the
                        %code Prune
                        button in the sidebar on the left.
                        That’s it! Your map is now pruned. Save with

                            %code CTRL+S
                        then you can close MCEdit. Be sure to remove any folders or files generated by MCEdit.
