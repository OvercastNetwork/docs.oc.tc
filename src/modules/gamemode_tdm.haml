                    This gamemode uses the [scoring](/modules/scoring) module to run the game for a specified amount of time, after which the team with the highest score wins. Teams increase their score by killing players from the other team or capturing points from a [score box](/modules/scoring#score_box).

                    `NOTE:` To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.

                    The `<time>` elements duration will default to seconds unless it is formatted as a [time period](/reference/time_periods).

                        <score>
                            <!-- Time till the match ends in seconds -->
                            <time>600</time>

                            <!-- Game ends when a team reaches this score, defaults to -1 i.e. no limit. -->
                            <limit>-1</limit>

                            <!-- +1 points for a kill -->
                            <kills>1</kills>
                            <!-- -1 points for dying -->
                            <deaths>1</deaths>
                        </score>

                    Kill scoring works as follows. Killing a player adds 1 point to the killers team score, kills from environmental damage such as lava or the void subtract 1 point from the dying players team score.
