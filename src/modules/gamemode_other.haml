                    ### [Ghost Squadron](id:gs)
                    Enables the ghostsquadron gamemode and all its features.
                    The default ghostsquadron classes can be found [here](https://maps.oc.tc/Blitz/GS/gs.xml).
                    Ghost squadron maps set a custom gamemode title in the `gs.xml` with the `<map game="Ghost Squadron">` attribute.
                    When not using the default GS XML include a custom title should be set.

                    `NOTE:` This module must be used in conjunction with another gamemode.

                        <ghostsquadron/>
                        <include src="gs.xml"/>

                    ### [Rage](id:rage)
                    Enable the one hit kill, rage style gamemode.

                    One hit kills will only be applied to items that have a sharpness enchantment greater than level 1. One shot arrow kills will only be applied to bows that have a power enchantment greater than level 1.

                    `NOTE:` This module must be used in conjunction with another gamemode.

                    ### [Team Death-match](id:tdm)
                    This gamemode uses the [scoring](/modules/scoring) module to run the game for a specified amount of time, after which the team with the highest score wins. Teams increase their score by killing players from the other team or capturing points from a [score box](/modules/scoring#score_box).

                    `NOTE:` To be able to score points for kills and deaths the `<kills>` and `<deaths>` elements are required.

                        <score>
                            <kills>1</kills>    <!-- +1 points for a kill -->
                            <deaths>1</deaths>  <!-- -1 points for dying -->
                        </score>

                        <!-- Time till the match ends in seconds (10 minutes) -->
                        <time>600</time>
