                :markdown
                    Kits are used when spawning and in healing / special item zones. See [items](/modules/items) for information on how to give items or items with special properties, and [potion effects](/reference/potion_effects) for information on how to give potion effects. Kits can inherit items from other kits by using the `parents=""` attribute. They are referenced by their `name=""` from [spawns](/modules/spawns) and [regions](/modules/regions).

                    Note that a kit will not empty a inventory, but rather overwrite specific slots. If you want to guarantee that a slot is empty use air with an amount of 0 as the material for that slot. See the [inventory reference](/reference/inventory#emptyKit) for an example of a completely empty inventory kit.

                    The force attribute will act differently for the individual sub-elements. If force is true, conflicting items or armor will be replaced instead of smartly merged & repaired, health & hunger will be set instead of only increased, and potion effects will be replaced instead of only non-existent effects added.

                        <kits>
                            <kit name="spawn" force="true">
                                <item slot="0">iron sword</item>
                                <item slot="8" amount="32">bread</item>
                                <potion duration="5" amplifier="1">heal</potion>
                            </kit>
                            <kit name="red" parents="spawn">
                                <helmet color="cd0000">leather helmet</helmet>
                            </kit>
                            <kit name="blue" parents="spawn">
                                <helmet color="0066cc">leather helmet</helmet>
                            </kit>
                        </kits>

                    In the example above players from blue team will get a blue helmet, players from red team will get a red helmet; both teams will get the items from the spawn kit. The spawn kit contains a 5 second healing [potion effect](/reference/potion_effects) to help prevent spawn killing.

                    `NOTE:` By default, `ambient="true"` is applied to all potions but can be overriden with `ambient="false"`.

                    #### Health & Hunger Kits
                    A players health and hunger can be modified with kits, this can be useful on maps with the `naturalRegeneration` [gamerule](/modules/gamerules) set to false.

                    By default health or hunger values are only increased, not decreased. For example, a player with 5 hearts (10 points) will not get a 5 health point kit applied, however a 20 point kit will be applied. This can be overwritten with a kits `force="true"` attribute.
