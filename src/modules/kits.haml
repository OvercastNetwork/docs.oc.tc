                    Kits are used when spawning and in healing / special item zones. See [items](/modules/items) for information on how to give items or items with special properties, and [potion effects](/reference/potion_effects) for information on how to give potion effects. Kits can inherit items from other kits by using the `parents=""` attribute. They are referenced by their `name=""` from [spawns](/modules/spawns) and [regions](/modules/regions).

                    Note that a kit will not empty a inventory, but rather overwrite specific slots. If you want to guarantee that a slot is empty use air as the material for that slot. See the [Babylon map XML](https://maps.oc.tc/Babylon/map.xml) for an example of a completely empty inventory kit.

                        <kits>
                            <kit name="spawn">
                                <item slot="0">iron sword</item>
                                <item slot="8" amount="32">bread</item>
                                <potion duration="5" amplifier="1">heal</potion>
                            </kit>
                            <kit name="red" parents="spawn">
                                <helmet color="cd0000">leather helmet</helmet>
                            </kit>
                            <kit name="blue" parents="spawn">
                                <helmet color="0066cc">leather helmet</helmet>
                            </kit>
                        </kits>

                    In the example above players from blue team will get a blue helmet, players from red team will get a red helmet; both teams will get the items from the spawn kit. The spawn kit contains a 5 second healing [potion effect](/reference/potion_effects) to help prevent spawn killing.
