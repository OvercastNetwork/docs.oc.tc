                    ### Rules
                    You can use the rules module to add custom rules to your map that are not already included in the standard Overcast Network rules. Regions and filters should be used to enforce access and block rules.

                        <rules>
                            <rule>A custom map rule</rule>
                            <rule>Attempting to access the observer's platform is fine so long as you do not intend to prolong the match</rule>
                        </rules>

                    <br/>
                    ### Broadcasts
                    The broadcast module allows you to broadcast a message to all players at any given point in the match.
                    Inside the broadcast tag you may specify either a `<alert>` or a `<tip>` message tag with an `after=""` attribute. This attribute is required and specifies how long after the match is started the broadcast is shown.  
                    The text in broadcasts can be formatted by using [formatting codes](/reference/formatting).
                    
                    This module should only be used to to show important information that is specific to the map. It should not be used to for generic OCN related messages.
