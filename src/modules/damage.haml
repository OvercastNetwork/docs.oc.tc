                    ### [Damage Filtering](id:filter)

                    This module is used to filter when or if damage is applied to entities.
                    Its contents can be a filter or combination of filters.
                    It doesn't have to be `<allow>` and `<deny>` at the top level but that's usually what you want.
                    Regions can also be used since they are filters that filter for a location.

                    Examples

                        <damage>
                            <deny>
                                <cause>explosion</cause>
                            </deny>
                        </damage>

                        <!-- Deny damage events where the attacker is on the red team -->
                        <damage>
                            <deny>
                                <attacker>
                                    <team>red</team>
                                </attacker>
                            </deny>
                        </damage>

                    ### [Disable Damage](id:disable)
                    Use this module to disable damage from specific causes.

                    While almost every form of damage can be disabled safely it is recommended that you do **not** disable `VOID` damage.

                    #### [Block Explosion Attributes](id:block_explosion)

                    The `BLOCK_EXPLOSION` damage cause has several extended attributes to customize who/what gets damaged. Only attributes with `false` as the value need to be explicitly defined since all attributes default to `true`.

                    #### [Damage Causes](id:causes)
                    The following damage causes can be used in the disable damage module.
                    These causes do not need to be capitalized or contain underscores, i.e., `FIRE_TICK` and `fire tick` will both work.
