                    Playable regions prevent any playing player from exiting or doing anything outside off the region. It also blocks damage from TNT, mobs, etc.

                    This can also be accomplished with a regular [region](/modules/regions) with the correct [filters](/modules/filters).

                    If there are multiple regions inside the `<playable>` module they are combined in a union, if you want to combine them differently put them into a [region combination](/modules/regions#regionCombinations).

                    <br/>
                    The playable region is defined as follows.

                        <playable>
                            <region name="main-area"/>
                            <cylinder base="-520.5,8,210.5" height="5" radius="10"/>
                        </playable>

                    Of course you will first need to create a region with `name="main-area"` or directly use a [region](/modules/regions) area.

                        <playable>
                            <cuboid min="-32,0,33" max="33,20,-32"/>
                        </playable>
