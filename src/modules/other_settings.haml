                            <depletion>off</depletion>

                    Specify a time limit for any objective map. If the time runs out before the objective is completed, the match ends in a tie.

                    `NOTE:` You can use [time formatters](/reference/formatting#time_formatters) to specify the time in minutes, etc.

                        <time result="objectives">1500</time>
