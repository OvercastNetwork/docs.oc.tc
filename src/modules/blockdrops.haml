                    This module can be used to customize what items drop when blocks are broken, and what the broken block is replaced with. All sub-elements are optional, if there are no elements blocks will simply drop nothing.

                    Custom drops also apply to blocks broken by explosions. The custom drops are reduced by 70% just like default explosion drops, though this can be customized through the [TNT module](/modules/tnt). Blocks broken by means other than mining or explosions currently do not cause custom drops.

                    The `<filter>` element is used to limit the rule to particular blocks. If multiple filters are listed, the rule will apply when *any* of them match. This filter is usually used to only filter what blocks the rule applies to. If filters such as `<team>` are used then no items or XP will drop if the block is mined by a non-matching player, the rules `<replacement>` material will still take effect however.

                    Items specified in the `<drops>` element can have any of the item attributes such as custom names, enchantments, attributes, etc. XP orbs are dropped by specifying the amount in the `<experience>` tag.

                    By default, custom drops won't appear if a block is mined with the "wrong" tool, e.g. stone mined with a shovel.
                    If `<wrongtool>true</wrongtool>` is added, the custom drops will happen regardless of what tool was used.

                    ### Explosion behavior

                    The behavior for blocks that become airborne due to explosions can be modified in addition to all the other drop rules.
