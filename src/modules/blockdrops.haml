                    This module can be used to customize what items drop when blocks are broken, and what the broken block is replaced with. 

                    The `<blockdrops>` tag can contain any number of `<rule>` tags, and each `<rule>` can contain various sub-tags:

                    The `<drops>` tag contains a list of `<item>`s to drop when a matching block is broken. These items can include any special data, such as custom names, enchantments, attributes, etc.
                    See [items](/modules/items) for details on how to use the `<item>` tag. XP orbs can also be dropped by specifying the
                    amount of XP in the `<experience>` tag.

                    The `<replacement>` tag can be used to specify a block other than air to replace the original block with when broken.

                    A `<filter>` tag can contain [filters](/modules/filters) that limit the rule to particular blocks.
                    If multiple filters are listed, the rule will apply when '''any''' of them match.
                    If filters such as <team> are used here then no items will drop if the block is mined by a non-matching player, but the `<replacement>` block is unaffected by this.

                    Likewise, a `<region>` tag can be used to limit the rule to particular [regions](/modules/regions).

                    By default, custom drops won't appear if a block is mined with the "wrong" tool, e.g. stone mined with a shovel.
                    If `<wrongtool>true</wrongtool>` is added, the custom drops will happen if the block is mined with any tool.

                    Custom drops also apply to blocks broken by explosions. In this case, the custom drops are reduced by 70% just like default drops, though this can be customized through the [TNT module](/modules/tnt).

                    Blocks broken by means other than mining or explosions currently do not cause custom drops.
