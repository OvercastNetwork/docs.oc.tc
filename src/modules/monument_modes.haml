                    **Notice**: Modes require a map protocol version of at least `1.3.2`.

                    This module can be used to customize the modes that cores and destroyables cycle through, and at what duration they do so.

                    The `<modes>` tag can contain any number of `<mode>` tags. Each `<mode>` has configurable characteristics that define it.

                    **Example**:

                        <modes>
                            <mode after="10m" material="gold block"/>
                        </modes>

                    This specifies a mode that will change the material of affected objectives to gold block after 10 minutes of gameplay.

                        <modes>
                            <mode after="5s" material="coal block" name="`eEASY MODE"/>
                        </modes>

                    This specifies a mode that will change the material of affected objectives to coal block after 10 minutes of gameplay, with the following chat message:

                        > > > EASY MODE < < <

                    **Note**: In order for an objective to change modes, it must have `mode-changes="true"` in its element tag.
