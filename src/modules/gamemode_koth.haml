                :markdown

                    KotH is a gamemode in which you capture and hold a hill to collect points. The first team to reach a preset amount of points wins. A KotH map can have multiple hills each with their own attributes such as capture time, etc.

                    ##### [Capture Rule](id:capture_rule)
                    The capture rule defines the logic used to decide which team is in control of the hill. Values for `capture-rule` can be one of the following:
                    
                    * `exclusive` The team must be the only team with players on the hill. (default)
                    * `majority` The team must have more players on the hill than all other teams combined.
                    * `lead` The team must have more players on the hill than any other single team.

                    Players who match either `capture-filter` or `defend-filter` are counted when calculating the `capture-rule`. Players who don't match either filter cannot affect the hill at all.

                :markdown
                    Capture progress is displayed inside the defined `<progress>` region using the dominating teams wool/clay/glass color. After a hill is captured the `<captured>` region is also filled with that teams wool/clay/glass color. If the `<captured>` region is not present it will use the `<progress>` region to display captured status. The progress and captured regions must be cuboids otherwise the plugin will throw an error.

                    #### [Scoring](id:scoring)
                    KotH games use the `<score>` module to end the game when one team reaches a preset amount of points. The `<king/>` tag prevents teams from getting points when killing players, this means they have to actually capture the hill to get points.

                    `NOTE:` King of the Hill maps may __not__ have a time limit.
