                        King of the Hill
                :markdown
                    KotH is a gamemode in which you capture and hold a hill to collect points. The first team to reach a preset amount of points wins. A KotH map can have multiple hills each with their own attributes such as capture time.

                                    The region to display if the hill is captured.

                :markdown
                    Capture progress is displayed inside the defined `<progress>` region using the dominating teams wool/clay color. After a hill is captured the `<captured>` region is also filled with that teams wool/clay color. If the `<captured>` region is not present it will use the `<progress>` region to display captured status. The progress and captured regions must be cuboids otherwise the plugin will throw an error.

                    #### [Scoring](id:scoring)
                    KotH games use the `<score>` module to end the game when one team reaches a preset amount of points. The `<king/>` tag prevents teams from getting points when killing players, this means they have to actually capture the hill to get points.

                    `NOTE:` King of the Hill maps may __not__ have a time limit.

                        <score>
                            <limit>500</limit>
                            <king/>
                        </score>
