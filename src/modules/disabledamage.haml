                :markdown
                    Use this module to disable damage from specific causes. While almost every form of damage can be disabled it is recommended that you do not disable `VOID` damage.

                            <!-- Disable fall damage -->

                    #### [Block Explosion Attributes](id:block_explosion)

                    The `BLOCK_EXPLOSION` damage cause has several extended attributes to customize who/what gets damaged. Only attributes with `false` as the value need to be explicitly defined since all attributes default to `true`.
