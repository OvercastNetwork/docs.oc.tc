                            Filters, regions, and kits now use `id` instead of `name`. <br/>
                            Keep in mind that IDs are all in the same namespace, so you can **not** use the same ID for two different types of thing.

                            Team have a `id` attribute and are always referenced by it everywhere in the XML, **never** by name.

                        :markdown
                            Standalone filter definitions are no longer wrapped in a `<filter>` tag, they start with an actual filter, just like regions, e.g.

                                <filters>
                                    <team id="only-red">red-team</team>
                                </filters>
                    %li
                        %span.label.label-danger Breaking
                        :markdown
                            The region for an `<apply>` must be either a `region` attribute or a `<region>` sub-element.
                            It cannot appear directly inside the `<apply>` tag.
                    %li
                        %span.label.label-danger Breaking
                        :markdown
                            Inline filters must always be a single tag, multiple tags are not accepted anywhere.
                            To combine multiple filters, always use a compound filter like `<all>` or `<any>`.
                            This change is retroactive, and affects _all_ proto versions.
                    %li

                        :markdown
                            There is no longer a filter type called `<block>`, use `<material>` instead. `<block>` is always interpreted as a region.
                    %li
                        %span.label.label-danger Breaking
                        :markdown
                            The old built-in filters are gone, and there are only two new ones: `always` which is equivalent to `allow-all`, and `never` which is equivalent to `deny-all`. <br/>
                            All of the new built-ins have equivalent tags of the same name i.e. `<always/>` & `<never/>`.
                    %li

                            Filters can no longer have parents.

                        %span.label.label-danger Breaking
                        :markdown
                            `<allow>` and `<deny>` can now be used anywhere a filter is expected, and actually function how they were supposed to i.e. they cause the filter to be ignored (skipped over) if it does not match.

                            Blitz or Ghost Squadron titles are no longer a part of the blitz module, instead they are set as a attribute of the `<map>` element and can be used with any gamemode.

                            Match time limit is no longer part of the `<score>` or `<blitz>` module, instead it is defined directly in the root <map> element.

                                <map proto="1.4.0">
                                <time result="objectives">5m</time>

                                <!-- Other modules. -->
                                </map>

                            The top-level tags `<filters>` and `<regions>` are now the same thing.
                            You can define filters, regions, and `<apply>`s in either one (remember that regions are a type of filter, have been for a while now).
                    %li
                        %span.label.label-primary Change
                        :markdown
                            Any filter tag anywhere can have an `id` attribute.

                        :markdown
                            The `<apply>` tag accepts both references and inline definitions for its `region`, `kit`, and all of its filter properties, e.g. the two tags below are equivalent:

                                <apply region="effect-pad" kit="effect-kit" filter="only-red" block="only-leaves" />

                                <apply>
                                    <region>
                                        <cuboid min="1,2,3" max="4,5,6"/> <!-- effect-pad -->
                                    </region>
                                    <kit>
                                        <potion>...</potion> <!-- effect-kit -->
                                    </kit>
                                    <filter>
                                        <team>red-team</team>
                                    </filter>
                                    <block>
                                        <material>leaves</material>
                                    </block>
                                </apply>
                    %li
                        %span.label.label-primary Change
                        :markdown
                            The `safe` and `spread` attributes of spawns can now be combined.

                            A items slot attribute is no longer required in kits.
                            This attribute now also accepts Mojang slot names e.g. `slot.hotbar.8` or `armor.head`.

                        :markdown
                            There is a new half-space region type that contains everything on one side of an arbitrary plane.
                            The plane is defined by an origin point and a normal vector, and the region contains everything on the side of the plane that the normal is pointing towards.
                            The example below defines a region with a diagonal boundary:

                                <half origin="5,0,0" normal="1,1,0"/>
                    %li

                        :markdown
                            Two new region types `<above>` and `<below>` can be used to conveniently define axis-aligned half-spaces:

                                <above y="50"/>         <!-- everything above Y=50 -->
                                <below x="0" z="0"/>    <!-- everything in the -X, -Z quadrant -->

                        :markdown
                            There are two built-in regions called `everywhere` and `nowhere` that contain all points and no points, respectively. <br/>
                            All of the new built-ins have equivalent tags of the same name i.e. `<everywhere/>` & `<nowhere/>`.
