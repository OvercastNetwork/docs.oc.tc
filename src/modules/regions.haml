                :markdown
                    Regions are used to define, among other things, the area a filter applies to or where a portal links from.

                    The area a region applies to is specified with one or more of the following elements. Use `oo` and `-oo` to specify positive/negative infinity in coordinates. All regions and region combinations can have a `name=""` attribute to reference them from kits, portals, etc.

                        <!-- Note that Y is the up/down axis in minecraft -->
                        
                        <rectangle name="something" min="X1,Z1" max="X2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A Rectangle from X1,Z1 to X2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <cuboid name="something" min="X1,Y1,Z1" max="X2,Y2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A rectangular solid from X1,Y1,Z1 to X2,Y2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <circle name="something" center="X1,Z1" radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A circle located at X1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        <!-- Goes from 0 to map height, i.e. PGM doesn't check the players Y position -->
                        
                        <cylinder name="something" base="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R" height="H"/>
                        <!-- A cylinder located at X1,Z1,Y1 with a radius of R and a height of H -->    
                        
                        <sphere name="something" origin="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A sphere located at X1,Y1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        
                        <block name="something">X,Y,Z</block>
                        <!-- A single block located at | X,Y,Z -->


                    `TIP:` Use the worldedit wand to help in defining region coordinates. Select an area and do `/size`, it will display two 3D coordinates. To use these coordinates you will have to take whichever X value is higher and add one to it, and then do the same for Y and Z. This is because PGM checks from the centre of blocks and WE checks from the corners. You don't have to do this for elements with just one coordinate such as: `<block>` or `<sphere>`.

                    For example: `min="49,13,-4" max="37,10,4"` would become `min="50,14,-4" max="37,10,5"`.

                    ####Applying Filters, Kits, and Velocity to Regions

                    Filters, kits, and velocity are applied to regions as attributes of the `<apply>` element. The apply element can contain more that one region. If the apply element contains more than one region the same settings applied to all of them.

                        <apply><region name="region1"/>..</apply>

                    Similar to kits regions are referenced by their `name=""`.
                    To use regions in spawns, portals, etc., reference them by their name.

                    Velocity can be applies in two ways, either by adding to the player's current velocity or by setting it. When setting the velocity, you use `@` in front of the number you want set. Otherwise you input the number of velocity you want added to the player's `x`, `y`, or `z` velocities.

                    A point provider is used to modify the position returned by a region to include the direction a player ends up facing when spawned, etc.
                    Input can be a region, a region combination or simply an exact `X,Y,Z` coordinate.

                        <point yaw="90" pitch="50" angle="">X,Y,Z</point>

                    `NOTE:` The pitch and yaw arguments can also accept a X,Y,Z coordinate.  
                    `TIP:` Copy the yaw from the F3 screen in minecraft (labled as `f`).
