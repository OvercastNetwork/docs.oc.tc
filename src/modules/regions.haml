                    Regions are used to define, among other things, the area a filter applies to or where a portal links from.

                    The area a region applies to is specified with one or more of the following elements. Use `oo` and `-oo` to specify positive/negative infinity in coordinates. All regions and region combinations can have a `name=""` attribute to reference them from kits, portals, etc.

                        <!-- Note that Y is the up/down axis in minecraft -->
                        
                        <rectangle name="something" min="X1,Z1" max="X2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A Rectangle from X1,Z1 to X2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <cuboid name="something" min="X1,Y1,Z1" max="X2,Y2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A rectangular solid from X1,Y1,Z1 to X2,Y2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <circle name="something" center="X1,Z1" radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A circle located at X1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        <!-- Goes from 0 to map height, i.e. PGM doesn't check the players Y position -->
                        
                        <cylinder name="something" base="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R" height="H"/>
                        <!-- A cylinder located at X1,Z1,Y1 with a radius of R and a height of H -->    
                        
                        <sphere name="something" origin="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A sphere located at X1,Y1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        
                        <block name="something">X,Y,Z</block>
                        <!-- A single block located at | X,Y,Z -->


                    `TIP:` Use the worldedit wand to help in defining region coordinates. Select an area and do `/size`, it will display two 3D coordinates. To use these coordinates you will have to take whichever X value is higher and add one to it, and then do the same for Y and Z. This is because PGM checks from the centre of blocks and WE checks from the corners. You don't have to do this for elements with just one coordinate such as: `<block>` or `<sphere>`.

                    For example: `min="49,13,-4" max="37,10,4"` would become `min="50,14,-4" max="37,10,5"`.

                    #### Referencing a Named Region 

                    Similar to kits regions are referenced by their `name=""`.
                    To use regions in spawns, portals, etc., reference them by their name.

                    	<regions>
                            <rectangle name="named-region" min="-50,-50" max="50,50"/>
                        </regions>

                    	<!-- Region reference -->
                        <region name="named-region"/>

                    ####Applying Filters, Kits, and Velocity to Regions

                    Filters, kits, and velocity changes are applied to regions as attributes of the `<apply>` element. The apply element can contain more than one region. If the apply element contains more than one region the same settings applied to all of them.

                        <apply><region name="region1"/>..</apply>

                    Applying kits to a region:

                        <!-- Give a kit to players entering the region -->
                        <apply kit="knight">

                    Applying filters to a region:

                        <filter name="only-blue" parents="deny-players">
                            <allow><team>blue</team></allow>

                    Multiple filters can be applied to a region at the same time by using different apply attributes.  
                    Example from [Boom](https://maps.oc.tc/DTM/Standard/Boom/map.xml), it uses the `block-break` and `block-place` attributes on the same apply tag.
                    
                        <apply block-break="only-sandstone-stairs" block-place="deny-all" message="You may not modify the TNT spawning area">

                    Velocity can be applied in two ways, either by modifying the player's current velocity or by setting an exact value. The velocity is specified as a `X,Y,Z` vector. To set an exact velocity vector, put `@` only in front of the first value.

                    `NOTE:` Modifying a players velocity is currently broken and will just set it.

                    `NOTE:` The pitch and yaw arguments can also accept a X,Y,Z coordinate.  
                    `TIP:` Copy the yaw from the F3 screen in minecraft (labled as `f`).
