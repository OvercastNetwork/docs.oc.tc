                    Regions are used to define, among other things, the area a filter applies to or where a portal links from.

                    The area a region applies to is specified with one or more of the following elements. Use `oo` and `-oo` to specify positive/negative infinity in coordinates. All regions and region combinations can have a `name=""` attribute to reference them from kits, portals, etc.

                        <!-- Note that Y is the up/down axis in minecraft -->
                        
                        <rectangle name="something" min="X1,Z1" max="X2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A Rectangle from X1,Z1 to X2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <cuboid name="something" min="X1,Y1,Z1" max="X2,Y2,Z2"/>
                        <!-- A rectangular solid from X1,Y1,Z1 to X2,Y2,Z2 -->
                        
                        <circle name="something" center="X1,Z1," radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A circle located at X1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        <!-- Goes from 0 to map height, i.e. PGM doesn't check the players Y position -->
                        
                        <cylinder name="something" base="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R" height="H"/>
                        <!-- A cylinder located at X1,Z1,Y1 with a radius of R and a height of H -->    
                        
                        <sphere name="something" origin="X1,Y1,Z1" radius="R"/>
                        <!-- A sphere located at X1,Y1,Z1 with a radius of R -->
                        
                        <block name="something">X,Y,Z</block>
                        <!-- A single block located at | X,Y,Z -->


                    `TIP:` Use the worldedit wand to help in defining region coordinates. Select an area and do `/size`, it will display two 3D coordinates. To use these coordinates you will have to take whichever X value is higher and add one to it, and then do the same for Y and Z. This is because PGM checks from the centre of blocks and WE checks from the corners. You don't have to do this for elements with just one coordinate such as: `<block>` or `<sphere>`.

                    For example : `min="49,13,-4" max="37,10,4"` would become `min="50,14,-4" max="37,10,5"`.

                    #####Applying Filters and Kits to Regions

                    Filters and kits are applied to regions as attributes of the `<apply>` element. The apply element can contain more that one region. If the apply element contains more than one region the same settings applied to all of them.

                        <apply><region name="region1"/>..</apply>
                        
                        
                    Attributes of the `<apply>` element
                        
                        enter="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter player enter events -->
                        
                        exit="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter player exit events -->
                        
                        block="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter block place and break events -->
                        
                        block-place="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter block place events -->
                        
                        block-break="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter block break events -->
                        
                        use="filter name"
                        <!-- Filter right-click events -->
                        
                        kit="kit name"
                        <!-- Give a kit to players entering the region -->

                        message="region message"
                        <!-- Send a message to the player if the filter modifies the event -->

                    <br/>
                    Example kit region from [Anathema](https://maps.oc.tc/Anathema/map.xml).

                        <!-- Give a kit to players entering the region -->
                        <apply kit="knight">
                            <region name="r-knight"/>
                            <region name="b-knight"/>
                        </apply>


                    Similar to kits regions are referenced by their `name=""`.
                    To use regions in spawns, portals, etc., reference them by their name.

                        <!-- Referencing a named region -->
                        <region name="region name"/>

                    Regions can be inverted, combined, subtracted, or intersected by putting them inside of the following elements.

                        <negative><region name="opti-region"/></negative>
                        <!-- Inverse of a region -->
                           
                        <union><region name="region1"/><region name="region2"/>..</union>
                        <!-- Combination of multiple regions -->
                           
                        <complement><region name="region1"/><region name="region2"/>..</complement>
                        <!-- Subtracts successive regions from the first defined region -->
