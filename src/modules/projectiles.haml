                    Projectiles can be modified to shoot a different entity at a custom speed. The PGM plugin will calculate the damage the projectile does using the same formula as minecraft does for arrows. This means that a flying fish with a velocity of 40 will almost certainly kill you.

                    All the following projectiles are guaranteed to work. See [mrapple/Bukkit Entity Spawning.md](https://gist.github.com/4617111) for a list of tested entities.
