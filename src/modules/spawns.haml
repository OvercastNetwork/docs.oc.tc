                    The spawns module is a required in a complete map XML because it specifies where players and observers can spawn. Default and observer spawns are defined with the `<default>` element. Only one default spawn element should be defined per map XML.

                    The main `<spawns>` element accepts a `bedspawn="on"` attribute to allow players to spawn at a saved bed spawn location. If a player has a bed spawn location set it overrides all other spawn regions for that player.
                    
                    `NOTE:` If a player uses a bedspawn, they will not spawn with their kit if one is specified.

                    The default element specifies where observers and players without a team spawn. There should only be a single default spawn.
                    `yaw=""` specifies what direction the player is looking horizontally from -180&deg; to 180&deg;. South 0&deg;, East -90&deg;, North 180&deg; and West 90&deg;.

                    `TIP:` You can copy the yaw from the F3 screen in minecraft.

                    Multiple spawns from the same team can be grouped inside of a single `<spawns team="team name">` element. Spawn positions are picked randomly inside of the defined regions. The plugin will not validate the spawn position by default. Regions should be checked to make sure that they don't intersect with solid objects or are midair. Spawns can also be defined with the `safe="true"` attribute, PGM will then check that the player spawns on a solid object and not midair.

                    Spawn elements accept more than one region or region area. If they are not inside a `<union>` element one region will be picked at random for each spawn event.
                    
                    `NOTE:` Sequential spawns must be used in conjunction with safe spawns.
