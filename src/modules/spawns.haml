                :markdown
                    The spawns module is a required in a complete map XML because it specifies where players and observers can spawn. Default and observer spawns are defined with the `<default>` element and all other spawns in `<spawn>` elements. Only one default spawn element should be defined per map.

                    To allow players to spawn at a bed set the main spawns bedspawn attribute to true. Players spawning at beds will not spawn with a kit even if there is one specified. If a player has a bed spawn location set it overrides all other spawn regions for that player.
                    
                    Multiple spawns from the same team can be grouped inside of a single `<spawns team="team name">` element. Spawn positions are picked randomly inside of the defined regions. Since the plugin will not validate the spawn position by default, regions should be checked to make sure that they don't intersect with solid objects or are midair. Spawns can also be defined with the `safe="true"` attribute, PGM will then check that the player spawns on a solid object and not midair.

                    Spawn elements accept more than one region or region area. If they are not inside a `<union>` element one region will be picked at random for each spawn event.
