                :markdown
                    Players have to retrieve wool blocks from the enemy teams side of the map and then put them on their victory monument(s). The area a wool has to be placed in is protected by default to prevent it from being blocked with another block.

                        <wools>
                           <wool team="blue" color="lime">
                               <block>0.5,11,-92.5</block>
                               <!-- Blue team has to place a lime wool block at 0.5,11,-92.5 to win -->
                           </wool>
                           <wool team="green" color="light blue" craftable="false">
                               <block>0.5,11,93.5</block>
                               <!-- Light blue wool can not be crafted, it must be picked up -->
                           </wool>
                        </wools>

                    You can group multiple victory monuments from the same team inside a single `<wools team="team name">` element; and then define that teams individual wool colors inside of a `<wool>` element.

                        <wools team="red">
                            <wool color="cyan">
                                <block>-60,26,-118</block>
                            </wool>
                            <wool color="lime">
