                :markdown
                    The `<killreward>` module allows players to get items or a kit when they kill someone. A kill reward can contain either individual items, kits or references to kits. Kits defined inside the module can contain any of the features that normal [kits](/modules/kits) have.


                    `e.g.` This module can be used to give upgrades to players by giving them gold ingots. Then once they have collected enough ingots they can craft armor, etc.

                    You can optionally include a [filter](/modules/filters#killStreakFilter) that determines which players are eligible to receive the reward.

                        <!-- Give two emeralds for all kills -->
                        <killreward>
                            <item amount="2">emerald</item>
                        </killreward>

                        <!-- Give a cactus to players on the red team for their third kill -->
                        <killreward>
                            <filter>
                                <all>
                                    <team>red</team>
                                    <kill-streak count="3"/>
                                </all>
                            </filter>
                            <item>cactus</item>
                        </killreward>

                    Kill rewards with kits

                        <killreward>
                            <kit>
                                <item slot="0">iron sword</item>
                                <helmet>iron helmet</helmet>
                                <potion amplifier="2">speed</potion>
                            </kit>
                        </killreward>

                        <!-- Give the "reward-kit" to the player for every 8th kill -->
                        <killreward>
                            <filter>
                                <kill-streak count="8" repeat="true"/>
                            </filter>
                            <kit name="reward-kit"/>
                        </killreward>
