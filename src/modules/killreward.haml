                :markdown
                    The kill reward module allows a player to get an item when they kill someone. The parameters are wrapped in a `<killreward>` block.
                    So far, the only reward available is an `<item>`.

                    `e.g.` This module can be used to give upgrades to players by giving them gold ingots. Then once they have collected enough ingots they can craft armor, etc.

                    Example

                        <!-- Kill Reward from Rift XML -->
                        <killreward>
                            <item amount="2">emerald</item>
                        </killreward>
