                :markdown
                    This module can create regions in which destroyed or altered blocks will gradually be restored to their original state.

                    The `<renewables>` tag can contain any number of `<renewable>` tags. Each `<renewable>` must have a `<region>` tag
                    to limit it to a particular region. Larger regions are more demanding on server resources, so don't make them any
                    larger than necessary. Regions under 10,000 blocks in volume should be safe. If a larger region is needed, it's best to inquire with a PGM developer or administrator first.

                    By default, all blocks in the region are renewable. Multiple `<renew>` tags can be used inside the `<renewable>` to specify only particular blocks to renew.

                    The `<replace>` tags specify which block types are allowed to be replaced by renewing blocks. Any other type of block in the renewable region will obstruct the renewal process. By default, any block can be replaced.

                    Normally, blocks will be restored to their exact state when the map was loaded. If some block types are specified in
                    `<shuffle>` tags, blocks of those types in the original region will be restored to a block type chosen at random from
                    the shuffleable types. The approximate proportions of block types from the original region will be preserved.

                    Renewables can also accept filters. They can be referenced from the filters module or defined directly inside the `<renew-filter>`, `<replace-filter>` and `<shuffle-filter>` renewable sub-elements. These sub-elements filter the renew, replace and shuffle block definitions respectively.
