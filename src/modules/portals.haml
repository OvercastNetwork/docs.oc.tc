                    Portals move a player that enters the specified region to a exact location or by by a certain offset amount. 

                        <portals>
                            <!-- Offset location, adds X,Y,Z, pitch and yaw to the players current location -->
                            <portal x="X" y="Y" z="Z" pitch="pitch" yaw="yaw" filter="filter name">
                                
                                <!-- Portal region, this is the region the player has to enter to be teleported -->
                                <cuboid min="X1,Y1,Z1" max="X2,Y2,Z2"/>
                            </portal>
                        </portals>

                    Position and direction attributes of the `<portal>` element are relative to the players location and where they are looking. Prefix values with an at symbol `@` to specify absolute values. Portals can be restricted to certain teams by defining their `filter=""` attribute.  

                    `yaw=""` specifies what direction the player is looking horizontally from -180&deg; to 180&deg;.  
                    _South 0&deg;, East -90&deg;, North 180&deg; and West 90&deg;._

                    `pitch=""` specifies what direction the player is looking vertically from -90&deg; to 90&deg;.  
                    _-90&deg; is straight up 90&deg; is straight down._

                    `TIP:` Copy the yaw from the F3 screen in minecraft (labled as `f`).
