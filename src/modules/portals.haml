                    Position and direction attributes of the `<portal>` element are relative to the players location and where they are looking. Prefix values with an at symbol `@` to specify absolute values. Portals can be restricted to certain teams by defining their `filter=""` attribute.  

                    `yaw=""` specifies what direction the player is looking horizontally from -180&deg; to 180&deg;.  
                    _South 0&deg;, East -90&deg;, North 180&deg; and West 90&deg;._

                    `pitch=""` specifies what direction the player is looking vertically from -90&deg; to 90&deg;.  
                    _-90&deg; is straight up 90&deg; is straight down._

                    `TIP:` Copy the yaw from the F3 screen in minecraft.
