                :markdown
                    Setup the teams, their names and represented colors.

                    Teams are referenced in regions, spawns, etc., by their name. The name matcher is case insensitive and fuzzy. For example, the teams below can be referenced with either `"Red Team" / "Blue Team"` or simply `"red" / "blue"`. When referencing teams care should be taken to make it obvious which team is being specified.

                    The soft player limit for each team is set with the `max=""` attribute and the hard limit with `max-overfill`. If max overfill is not explicitly defined the default will be set to 25% over the maximum team size. Players will not be able to join teams once the max overfill team size is reached.

                    Optionally, you may include a `respawn-limit` attribute, being the maximum number of times members of a team can collectively respawn before the team becomes "locked". If a team becomes locked, that means that that team may not be joined, and is discounted in any checks for wins, regardless of how many cores they have leaked, wools they have captured, and etc. Donors are not exempt from these joining restrictions. If only one team has respawns left, then they will automatically win.  If multiple teams are left with respawns, the game will continue until either a single team completes all goals, or only one team is left with respawns.

                    It is common for maps to only have 2 teams, although more are possible it usually just causes confusion.

                        <teams>
                           <team id="red-team" color="dark red" max="50" max-overfill="70">Red Team</team>
                           <team id="blue-team" color="blue" max="50" max-overfill="70">Blue Team</team>
                        </teams>

                    The total maximum number of players in the example given above is 100, however, the max overfill will allow up to 140 players. Servers currently have a player limit of 150, so 100 players in total would allow 50 observers, or 10 observers if teams are at max overfill.
