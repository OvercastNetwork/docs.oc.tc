                    Setup the teams, their names and represented colors. See [bukkit colors](/reference/formatting) for valid team colors. The player limit for each team is defined inside of the `max=""` attribute. Teams can have a custom overhead color with the `overhead-color=""` attribute.  

                    `NOTE:` It is common for maps to only have 2 teams, although more are possible. It usually just causes confusion.

                        <teams>
                           <team color="dark red" max="50">Red Team</team>
                           <team color="blue" max="50">Blue Team</team>
                        </teams>

                    Don't forget that the total maximum number of players in the above example is 100. Maps currently have a player limit of 150, so 100 players in total would allow 50 observers.
