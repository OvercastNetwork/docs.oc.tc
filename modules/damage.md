### Friendly Fire
Allows teammates to kill each other. Arrows will be absorbed if they hit a teammate.

    <friendlyfire>on</friendlyfire> <!-- Defaults to off -->

Refunds arrows blocked by teammates from non-infinity bows.

    <friendlyfirerefund>off</friendlyfirerefund> <!-- Defaults to on -->

<br/>

### Difficulty
The difficulty level can be set to `peaceful`, `easy`, `normal`, or `hard`. The default is `hard`.

    <difficulty>easy</difficulty> <!-- Defaults to hard -->

<br/>

### Hunger
Specify if a player can starve to death, usually used with the difficulty setting.<br/>
This can also be accomplished with the `naturalRegeneration` [gamerule](/modules/gamerules).

    <hunger>
        <depletion>off</depletion>
    </hunger>

<br/>

### Damage Filtering {#filtering}

This module is used to filter when or if damage is applied to entities.
Its contents can be a filter or combination of filters.
It doesn't have to be `<allow>` and `<deny>` at the top level but that's usually what you want.
Regions can also be used since they are filters that filter for a location.

Examples

    <damage>
        <deny>
            <cause>explosion</cause>
        </deny>
    </damage>

    <!-- Deny damage events where the attacker is on the red team -->
    <damage>
        <deny>
            <attacker>
                <team>red</team>
            </attacker>
        </deny>
    </damage>

<br/>

### Disable Damage {#disable}
Use this module to disable damage from specific causes.

While almost every form of damage can be disabled safely it is recommended that you do **not** disable `VOID` damage.

<div class='table-responsive'>
  <table class='table table-striped table-condensed'>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Disable Damage Element</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <span class='highlight'>
            <code>{{'<disabledamage> </disabledamage>' | escape_once}}</code>
          </span>
        </td>
        <td>Node containing the disabled damage types.</td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th colspan='2'>Sub-elements</th>
        <th>Value/Children</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <span class='highlight'>
            <code>{{'<damage> </damage>' | escape_once}}</code>
          </span>
        </td>
        <td>
          The damage type that is disabled.

          <a href='#causes'>Damage Cause</a>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Example

    <disabledamage>
        <!-- Disable fall damage -->
        <damage>fall</damage>
    </disabledamage>


<br/>

### Block Explosion Attributes

The `BLOCK_EXPLOSION` damage cause has several extended attributes to customize who/what gets damaged. Only attributes with `false` as the value need to be explicitly defined since all attributes default to `true`.

<div class='table-responsive'>
  <table class='table table-striped table-condensed'>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Default</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>ally</code>
        </td>
        <td>Damage to players on the same team as the person that caused the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span class='label label-primary'>true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>self</code>
        </td>
        <td>Damage to the person that caused the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span class='label label-primary'>true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>enemy</code>
        </td>
        <td>Damage to players not on the same team as the person that caused the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span class='label label-primary'>true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <code>other</code>
        </td>
        <td>Any other damage caused by the explosion.</td>
        <td>
          <span class='label label-primary'>true/false</span>
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

Example

    <disabledamage>
        <!-- TNT damages enemies and self, but not teammates -->
        <damage ally="true" self="false" enemy="false" other="false">block explosion</damage>
    </disabledamage>

### Damage Causes {#causes}
The following damage causes can be used in the disable damage module.
These causes do not need to be capitalized or contain underscores, i.e., `FIRE_TICK` and `fire tick` will both work.
