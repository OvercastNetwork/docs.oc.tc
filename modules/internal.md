Maps that are entirely indoors or underground can use the `internal` attribute on the [main map element](/modules/main)
to prevent observers from accidentally teleporting on top of the map with the compass tool.
In order for this to work, the exterior of the map must be completely filled in with solid blocks,
all the way up to the maximum build height.

See [Main Map Element](/modules/main)
