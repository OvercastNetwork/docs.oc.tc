Section Kill Reward should be edited to:

Kill Reward
The kill reward module allows a player to get an item when they kill someone. The parameters are wrapped in a <killreward> block. So far, the only reward available is an <item>.

e.g. This module can be used to give upgrades to players by giving them gold ingots. Then once they have collected enough ingots they can craft armor, etc.


Example

<!-- Kill Reward from Rift XML -->
<killreward>
    <item amount="2">emerald</item>
</killreward>

Kill rewards can be filtered by adding a filter tag inside the <killreward> module.

e.g. This option can be used to reward attackers and defenders with different team specific items, which only each team can use.

<!-- Kill Reward from BoomBox XML -->
<killreward>
    <filter>
        <team>defenders</team>
    </filter>
    <item amount="8">arrow</item>
</killreward>
<killreward>
    <filter>
        <team>attackers</team>
    </filter>
    <item amount="32">snow ball</item>
</killreward>
